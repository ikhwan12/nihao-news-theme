The easiest way to manage your organization's job openings, and allow candidates to submit their resumes through your website. Display your jobs on a careers page!

== Description ==

WP Job Portal displays your jobs on your careers page, allows candidates to apply online through your website, and then organizes their resumes in your very own applicant tracking system (ATS). Being shortcode based, WP Job Portal works with any theme, is really simple to setup, and best of all is FREE!



= Features =



* Create a careers page or enable your existing careers page to automatically display new job openings

* Create or edit new job openings

* Invite team members to create new job openings

* Allow candidates to apply online by uploading their resumes and cover letters (if desired)

* Organize candidate resumes by job in our free applicant tracking system (ATS) instead of in your inbox

* Rate candidate resumes and take notes

* Use our widget to list job openings on page sidebars and footers

* Create unique pages for specific jobs and add featured images

* Job listings and job pages automatically adopt your theme’s unique styles



The plugin comes with two types of shortcodes:

1. The main shortcode lists all your job openings

2. Each job gets a unique shortcode that can be placed in any page or post

In the search field type “wp job portal by jane” and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

After installing the plugin, click _Activate_ and you will be taken through WP Job Portal’s 3-step setup wizard.
